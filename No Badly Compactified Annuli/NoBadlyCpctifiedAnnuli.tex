\section{Introduction}
The following is a result about the structure of compact three-manifolds admitting fixed point-free $\homeoS$ actions having only one dimensional and annulus orbits. As a matter of convention, denote we denote configuration space actions and their lifts to covers by $*$. A fact we will make repeated use of to prove these results is the following:

\begin{rem}
    Let $\pi_{SO(2)}$ denote the projection along the orbits of the rotation subgroup to the base orbifold. Then, since $M^3$ and the base orbifold are compact Hausdorff spaces, by a classical fact from point-set topology, $\pi_{SO(2)}$ is a closed map.
\end{rem}

\section{Global structure}
Consider the subset of $M$ consisting of 1-dimensional orbits. The set $\text{fix}(G_0)$ is closed, and $\pi_{SO(2)}$ is a closed map, so $\pi_{SO(2)}(\text{fix}(G_0))$ is closed in the base surface. By continuity then $\pi_{SO(2)}^{-1}(\pi_{SO(2)}(\text{fix}(G_0)))$,which is the union of all of the one-dimensional orbits, is closed.
The complement is then an open subset of $M$ which decomposes into annulus orbits. It is natural to ask about the structure of this open region. Below are two ipmortant structural results:

\section{Foliation by Annuli}

We seek to investigate the structure of an open region consisting of orbits of the same type. For what follows, consider $X$ a connected component of the open region consisiting entirely of annulus orbits. Of primary relevance in our investigation will be the map $p: X\to \text{Conf}_2(S^1)$ given by $p(x) = (\theta, \varphi)$ where $\theta$ and $\varphi$ are the unique points in $S^1$ such that $x\in\text{fix}(G_\theta\cap G_\varphi)$. First, an elementary property of group actions.

\begin{rem}
    Suppose there is an action of group $G$ on $M$ by homeomorphisms and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. Then, for all $g\in G$,
    $$g * \text{fix}(H) = \text{fix}(g H g^{-1})$$
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $y\in g * \text{fix}(H)$, then $g^{-1}*y\in \text{fix}(H)$. I.e., $(hg^{-1})*y = g^{-1}*y$ for all $h\in H$. So, by cancellation, $(ghg^{-1})*y = y$ for all $h\in H$; thus, $y\in \text{fix}(g H g^{-1})$. Each step was reversible, so this concludes the proof of equality.
\end{proof}

A similar (but dual) argument shows that for any $f\in\homeoS$ and $G_\theta$ a point stabilizer subgroup, $f G_\theta f^{-1} = G_{f(\theta)}$.

\begin{prop}
    The map $p$ is equivariant, continuous, and its fibers are homeomorphic.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    First, we check equivariance. Suppose $x\in X$, $f\in\homeoS$ and $p(x)=(\theta, \varphi)$. Under the standard configuration space action $f*p(x) = (f(\theta), f(\varphi))$. So we, need to check that $\rho(f)(x)\in \text{fix}(\rho(G_{f(\theta)}\cap G_{f(\varphi)}))$. By the remark, $$\rho(f)(\text{fix}(G_\theta \cap G_\varphi)) = \text{fix}(\rho(f(G_\theta\cap G_\varphi)f^{-1}))$$
    Then, pulling the conjugation through the intersection and applying the second remark,
    $$\rho(f)(\text{fix}(G_\theta \cap G_\varphi)) = \text{fix}(\rho(G_{f(\theta)}\cap G_{f(\varphi)}))$$
    Thus, $f*p(x) = p(\rho(f)(x))$.

    Second, we check continuity by checking that open neighborhoods of points in $\text{conf}_2(S^1)$ pull back to open subsets of $X$. Let $(a, b)$ be a point $\text{conf}_2(S^1)$ and $U = (I, J)$ be a small open neighborhood of $(a,b)$ consisting of small disjoint open intervals $I$ and $J$ around $a$ and $b$ in $S^1$. Denote by $H(I)$ and $H(J)$ the subgroups of $\homeoS$ supported on $I$ and $J$ respectively. We will show that $p^{-1}(U)$ is open by proving that 
    $$p^{-1}(U) = X - \left(\text{fix}(\rho(H(I)))\cup\text{fix}(\rho(H(J)))\right)$$
    Suppose $x\notin p^{-1}(U)$, then in particular for $p(x) = (\theta, \varphi)$, assume without loss of generality $\theta, \varphi \notin I$. Then by definition, every element of $H(I)$ fixes $(\theta, \varphi)$, so by equivariance, $x\in \text{fix}(\rho(H(I)))$. In particular, $x$ is not in the right hand side of the desired equality. Now, suppose $x\in p^{-1}(U)$, then in particular $p(x) = (\theta, \varphi)$ for some $\theta\in I, \varphi\in J$. Fix an equivariant homeomorphism $\varphi$ from the $\homeoS$ orbit of $x$ to $\pconf{2}$ such that $\psi(x) = (\theta, \varphi)$. Then, in particular we know $\rho(f)(x) = \psi^{-1}(f(\theta), f(\varphi))$ and thus if $f\in H(I) - G_\theta$ then $f\notin \text{Stab}(x)$. The contrapositive of this is then that $x\notin \text{fix}(\rho(H(I)))$. A symmetric argument will show that $x\notin \text{fix}(\rho(H(J)))$, so it is not in the union. Since fixed point sets are closed, their union is as well, thus the complement here is open. So this shows $p$ is open.

    Finally, we can demonstrate that for a point $(x,y)\in\conf{2}$, there is a homeomorphism from $F$ to $p^{-1}(x, y)$. Simply choose a homeomorphism $h\in\homeoS$ such that $h(b) = (x, y)$, then by equivariance of $p$, $\rho(h)$ restricts to a homeomorphism $F\to p^{-1}(x,y)$.
\end{proof}



\section{2D Orbits Compactify Nicely}
As a small point of notation, recall the following definition from point set topology:
\begin{defn}
    The {\it frontier} of a set $X$, denoted $\text{fr}(X)$ is defined as $\cl{X}-X$
\end{defn}

When $X$ is a 2-dimensional orbit, we use the following notation for convenience.

\begin{defn}
    Let $A$ be an annulus orbit, fix a model annulus $f:A\to S^1\times I$. Then, denote by $\text{fr}_+(A)$ the set of frontier points which can be accumulated by sequences with increasing $I$ coordinate and $\text{fr}_-(A)$ analogously. Note that $\text{fr}_+(A)\cup\text{fr}_-(A) = \text{fr}(A)$, but they are not necessarily distinct. We can compatibly label subsets of the frontier of a $G_0$ invariant interval in an annulus $A$. For notational consistency, when $X$ is a M\"{o}bius band orbit, let $\text{fr}_+(X) = \text{fr}_-(X) = \text{fr}(X)$.
\end{defn}

For the following two proofs, we want to make use of a kind of canonical coordinates on interval orbits of $G_0$.

\begin{rem}\cite{mann-chen}
    Suppose $A$ is an annulus orbit of $\homeoS$ and $I\subset A$ is an interval orbit of $G_0$. Then, we can define two homeomorphisms $\varphi, \psi:(0,1) \to I$ by $\varphi(\theta) = \text{fix}(G_0\cap G_\theta)$ and $\psi(\theta) = \text{fix}(G_0\cap G_{-\theta})$. One of these maps will send monotonic sequences that converge to $1$ to sequences which converge to something in $\text{fr}_+(I)$, we will denote the inverse of this map as $f_I$, which we will refer to as the {\it canonical homeomorphism between $I$ and $S^1 - \{0\}$}. Note, the same construction works for the one interval orbit in a M\"{o}bius band orbit.
\end{rem}

The following results are true for 2-dimensional orbits of any $\homeoS$ action without fixed points on a closed 3-manifold.

\begin{prop}
    Suppose $X$ is an 2-dimensional orbit, then $\text{fr}(X)$ consists of 1-dimensional orbits.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Trivially, $\text{fr}(X)$ contains no 3-dimensional orbit.

    Suppose toward a contradiction that $\text{fr}(X)$ contains some 2-dimensional orbit $X'$. Now, consider the restriction of the $\homeoS$ action to the point stabilizer subgroup $G_0$. There is some interval orbit $I$ in $X$. Since $\pi_{SO(2)}$ is continuous and closed, $$\pi_{SO(2)}(\bar{I}) = \overline{\pi_{SO(2)}(I)} = \overline{\pi_{SO(2)}(A)} = \pi_{SO(2)}(\bar{A}).$$ In particular, this means that $\text{fr}(I)$ must nontrivially intersect $X'$. The closure of every $G_0$ orbit in $X'$ contains at least one interval orbit $I'$, so $I'\subseteq \text{fr}(I)$. In particular, there is some sequence of points $\{x_n\}\subset I$ converging to a point $x\in I'$.

    From the remark, there are continuous bijections $f:I\to S^1-\{0\}$ and $g:I'\to S^1-\{0\}$ given by mapping the unique fixed point of $G_\theta\cap G_0$ on $I$ to $\theta\in S^1 - \{0\}$ and similarly for $I'$. Then, up to a subsequence, $\{f(x_n)\}$ is a monotonic sequence converging to 0. So we can choose a monotonic element $\phi\in G_0$ satisfying $\phi(f(x_k)) = f(x_{k+1})$. In particular, we must have that $\{\rho(\phi)( x_n)\}$ converges to $x$, but by monotonicity, $\rho(\phi)(x) \neq x$, violating continuity, which is a contradiction. Thus $\text{fr}(A)\cap X = \emptyset$
\end{proof}

Note that, in particular if $X$ is an annulus orbit in a component foliated by annuli, this implies that $\text{fr}(X)$ is a subset of the frontier of the component.

We can in fact say something stronger.

\begin{prop}
    Suppose $X$ is a 2-dimensional orbit. Then, $\text{fr}_+(X)$ and $\text{fr}_-(X)$ are (not necessarily distinct) one-dimensional orbits.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are invariant circles in (WLOG) $\text{fr}_+(X)$ with respective $G_0$ fixed points $x$ and $x'$. Let $I$ be a $G_0$-invariant interval in $X$. By the same reasoning as the previous result, $x, x'\in \text{fr}(I)$, so let $\{a_k\}$ and $\{b_k\}$ be sequences in $I$ reperesenting $x$ and $x'$. Since both sequences are monotonic in $I$, there is a homeomorphism $f\in G_0$ such that $\rho(f)(a_k) = b_k$. By continuity, this implies that $\{b_k\}$ converges to $\rho(f)(x)$, which is $x$, since $x\in\text{fix}(G_0)$. Thus, $x=x'$; morevoer, $\sigma = \sigma'$ since every fixed point of $G_0$ is part of a unique 1-dimensional orbit of $\homeoS$.
\end{proof}

This result can be rephrased in a slightly more concrete way.

\begin{cor}
    When $X$ is an annulus orbit, $\bar{X}$ is either an invariant closed annulus with boundary circles $\text{fr}_+(A)$ and $\text{fr}_-(A)$ or an invariant $T^2$ when $\text{fr}_-(A) = \text{fr}_+(A)$.

    When $X$ is a M\"{o}bius band orbit, $\bar{X}$ is an invariant closed M\"{o}bius band, with invariant boundary circle $\text{fr}(X)$.
\end{cor}
