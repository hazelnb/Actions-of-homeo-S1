	abstract = {We present an overview of the study of the Thurston norm, introduced by W. P. Thurston in the seminal paper "A norm for the homology of 3-manifolds" (written in 1976 and published in 1986). We first review fundamental properties of the Thurston norm of a 3-manifold, including a construction of codimension-1 taut foliations from norm-minimizing embedded surfaces, established by D. Gabai. In the main part we describe relationships between the Thurston norm and other topological invariants of a 3-manifold: the Alexander polynomial and its various generalizations, Reidemeister torsion, the Seiberg-Witten invariant, Heegaard Floer homology, the complexity of triangulations and the profinite completion of the fundamental group. Some conjectures and questions on related topics are also collected. The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the book "In the tradition of Thurston, {II}", edited by K. Ohshika and A. Papadopoulos (Springer, 2022).},

Actions without fixed points and without special exceptional orbits are manifolds admitting singular fiberings in the sense of Seifert [4]. Most of these manifolds were shown topologically distinct in [2]. In the last section of the present report we complete the classification of {SO}(2) actions by considering those manifolds not treated in [2] and fixed point free actions with special exceptional orbits.},

More precisely, we show that, for an almost-complex manifold \$M{\textasciicircum}\{2mn\}\$(resp. a smooth manifold \$N{\textasciicircum}\{4mn\}\$), if there exists a partition \${\textbackslash}lambda=({\textbackslash}lambda\_\{1\},...,{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{u\})\$ of weight \$m\$ such that the Chern number \$(c\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{1\}\}... c\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{u\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{n\}[M]\$ (resp. Pontrjagin number \$(p\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{1\}\}... p\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{u\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{n\}[N]\$) is nonzero, then {\textbackslash}emph\{any\} circle action on \$M{\textasciicircum}\{2mn\}\$ (resp. \$N{\textasciicircum}\{4mn\}\$) has at least \$n+1\$ fixed points. When an even-dimensional smooth manifold \$N{\textasciicircum}\{2n\}\$ admits a semi-free action with isolated fixed points, we show that \$N{\textasciicircum}\{2n\}\$ bounds, which generalizes a well-known fact in the free case. We also provide a topological obstruction, in terms of the first Chern class, to the existence of semi-free circle action with {\textbackslash}emph\{nonempty\} isolated fixed points on almost-complex manifolds. The main ingredients of our proofs are Bott's residue formula and rigidity theorem.},

Cardinal and ordinal numbers are also discussed, along with topological, metric, and complete spaces. Great use is made of closure algebra. Comprised of three chapters, this volume begins with a discussion on general topological spaces as well as their specialized aspects, including regular, completely regular, and normal spaces. Fundamental notions such as base, subbase, cover, and continuous mapping, are considered, together with operations such as the exponential topology and quotient topology. The next chapter is devoted to the study of metric spaces, starting with more general spaces, having the limit as its primitive notion. The space is assumed to be metric separable, and this includes problems of cardinality and dimension. Dimension theory and the theory of Borei sets, Baire functions, and related topics are also discussed. The final chapter is about complete spaces and includes problems of general function theory which can be expressed in topological terms. The book includes two appendices, one on applications of topology to mathematical logics and another to functional analysis. This monograph will be helpful to students and practitioners of algebra and mathematics.},

Our constructions are elementary and give simple global coordinates for the compactified configuration space of a general manifold embedded in Euclidean space. We stratify the canonical compactification, identifying the diffeomorphism types of the strata in terms of spaces of configurations in the tangent bundle, and give completely explicit local coordinates around the strata as needed to define a manifold with corners. We analyze the quotient map from the canonical to the simplicial compactification, showing it is a homotopy equivalence. We define projection maps and diagonal maps, which for the simplicial variant satisfy cosimplicial identities.},
