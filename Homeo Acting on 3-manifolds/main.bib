It is proved that such actions are determined by their weighted orbit spaces and are in 1-1 correspondence with "legally-weighted" 3-manifolds. The information contained in the weighted orbit space is used to give a presentation of the fundamental group of the 4-manifold, and in certain cases the quadratic form is computed.},

Cardinal and ordinal numbers are also discussed, along with topological, metric, and complete spaces. Great use is made of closure algebra. Comprised of three chapters, this volume begins with a discussion on general topological spaces as well as their specialized aspects, including regular, completely regular, and normal spaces. Fundamental notions such as base, subbase, cover, and continuous mapping, are considered, together with operations such as the exponential topology and quotient topology. The next chapter is devoted to the study of metric spaces, starting with more general spaces, having the limit as its primitive notion. The space is assumed to be metric separable, and this includes problems of cardinality and dimension. Dimension theory and the theory of Borei sets, Baire functions, and related topics are also discussed. The final chapter is about complete spaces and includes problems of general function theory which can be expressed in topological terms. The book includes two appendices, one on applications of topology to mathematical logics and another to functional analysis. This monograph will be helpful to students and practitioners of algebra and mathematics.},

When an even-dimensional smooth manifold \$N\textasciicircum\{2n\}\$ admits a semi-free action with isolated fixed points, we show that \$N\textasciicircum\{2n\}\$ bounds, which generalizes a well-known fact in the free case. We also provide a topological obstruction, in terms of the first Chern class, to the existence of semi-free circle action with \textbackslash emph\{nonempty\} isolated fixed points on almost-complex manifolds. The main ingredients of our proofs are Bott's residue formula and rigidity theorem.},
