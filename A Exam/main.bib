	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to give a complete equivariant and topological classification of the effective actions of the circle group, {SO}(2), on closed, connected 3-manifolds. The equivariant classification was given in [3] together with the topological classification of actions with fixed points. Actions without fixed points and without special exceptional orbits are manifolds admitting singular fiberings in the sense of Seifert [4]. Most of these manifolds were shown topologically distinct in [2]. In the last section of the present report we complete the classification of {SO}(2) actions by considering those manifolds not treated in [2] and fixed point free actions with special exceptional orbits.},
