\section{Introduction}
This writeup is an extension of what I've written in No Badly Compactified Annuli. This will prove a general version of the {\it Orbit Bundle Structure} which concerns the structure of connected regions consisting of orbits of a fixed dimension. As of writing, this result takes as an input that the region is a manifold (would be ideal to have settings that this can be relaxed). 

The setting of the generalized bundle structure result is the following.  Suppose $\homeo[M]$ acts on $N$, and $X$ is a connected submanifold of $N$ with orbits of fixed dimension. Fix a base point $b\in \conf[M]{n}$. We will abuse notation by denoting both the point in $\conf[M]{n}$ and the corresponding subset of $M$ as $b$. Also, note that the deck group of the maximal admissible covering $C_b \to \conf[M]{n}$ can be identified with $\text{stab}(b)/\text{stab}_0(b)\subset\homeo[M]$.

\begin{prop}[Orbit Bundle]
    Suppose $X$ a connected submanifold of $N$ with orbits of fixed dimension, then there is a continuous map $p: X\to \conf[M]{n}$ such that there's a map: $$I: C_n \times p^{-1}(b) / \Gamma \to X$$
    where $\Gamma$ is the deck group of the covering $C_n \to \conf[M]{n}$ acting on the first factor by deck transformations and the second factor by the $\homeo[M]$ action restricted to the subgroup $\Gamma$ acting on the fiber. The map $I$ is an equivariant homeomorphism with the $\homeo[M]$ action on $C_n \times p^{-1}(b) / \Gamma$ be the quotient of the product of the standard action on $C_n$ with the trivial action on the fiber.
\end{prop}

\section{Codimension 1 Orbit Bundles}
For components of codimension 1 orbits, the fiber must be 1-dimensional and all 1-dimensional homology manifolds are manifolds. So, codimension 1 orbit bundlses are classified by actions of the deck group of $\Gamma$ of the covering $C_X \to \conf[M]{n}$ on 1-manifolds up to equivariant homeomorphism. Note that, in general, $\lvert \pi_0(F) \rvert \leq \lvert \Gamma \rvert$ and the components of $F$ are homeomorphic. 

It's hard to say something overly general here, but fixing $M = S^1$ and $\text{dim}(N)=3$ a classification is possible. Note, in this setting $C_X = \pconf{2}$ and $\Gamma = \Z_2$.

\begin{prop}
    The classification of $\homeo$ codimension 1 orbit bundles $X$ in 3-manifolds is as follows. 
    \begin{description}
        \item[$F$ disconnected] $F\cong C\sqcup C$ for a 1-manifold $C$, $X\cong \pconf{2}\times C$ and $\pi_{SO(2)}(X) \cong I \times C$
        \item[$F$ connected] \ 
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\Z_2$ acts on $F$ f.p. free] $F\cong S^1$, action is by a $\pi$ rotation. $X\cong \pconf{2} \times S^1$ and $\pi_{SO(2)} \cong I\times S^1$
            \item[$\Z_2$ acts on $F$ w/ fixed points] This depends on $F$, on each $\Z_2$ acts by reflection. Note in each case, the bundle is described in terms of the Seifert structure given by the $SO(2)$ action.
            \begin{description}
                \item[$F\cong \R$] $X$ is $(\mathring{\mathbb{D}}^2, (2, 1))$
                \item[$F\cong S^1$] $X$ is $(\mathring{\mathbb{D}}^2, (2, 1), (2,1))$
                \item[$F \cong \lbrack 0,1\rbrack$] $X$ is $(\mathring{\mathbb{D}}^2\cup I, (2,1))$ where $I$ is a interval in the boundary of the closed disk $\mathbb{D}^2$
            \end{description}
            \item[$\Z_2$ acts trivially] $X\cong\conf{2}\times C$ {\it N.B. resulting bundle is nonorientable (and top dimensional), so $N$ is as well} 
        \end{description}
    \end{description}
    A generic component $C$ of the fiber is one of $S^1,\, \mathbb{R},\, [0,1]\, \text{or}\,  [0,1)$
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Note that the quotient gives a 2-fold covering from $\pconf{2}\times F$ to the orbit bundle $X$, which is connected, so $\pconf{2}\times F$ and thus $F$ has at most two components. Assume $F$ has two components. Since the quotient is connected, the action must permute the components (homeomorphically), so in particular we can express the fiber as $F\cong C\sqcup C$. Then the action is just a homeomorphism from one compenent of $\pconf{2}\times F$ to the other, so the quotient is $\pconf{2}\times C$ where the resulting $\homeo$ action is the standard configuration space action on the $\pconf{2}$ coordinate and the trivial action on the $C$ coordinate.

    If $F$ has a single component, then the $\Z_2$ action is simply a choice of involution on $F$. For any possible $F$ we can allow $\Z_2$ to act trivially. Then, the quotient loads entirely onto the $\pconf{2}$ factor, where $\Z_2$ acts as the deck group of $\pconf{2}\to\conf{2}$, so the resulting quotient is $\conf{2}\times F$. This is nonorientable (regardless of $F$) and top-dimensional, so in general, such orbit bundles only arise when $N$ is nonorientable. The remainder of the proof is done by exhaustion. $[0,1)$ has no nontrivial involutions, $[0,1]$ and $\mathbb{R}$ each have one and $S^1$ has two. In each case, the quotient preserves the product structure away from fixed points and sends every $\pconf{2} \times \{x\}$ for fixed point $x$ to $\conf{2}\times \{x\}$. The result in each case is trivially the Seifert structure described in the proposition.
\end{proof}
